Stock Inventory
---------------
+ Determine what data to track
  qty on-hand
  value of totals items
  suppliers (maintain 2,3,or 4?)

  Determine how to keep data for average price calculation
 - one thing is to keep the total price of all items and total number of the items in a
   price history file and up[date the price history file as new items are purchased
 - we could also maintain a field for each item with total price and total item-count but
   we lose the ability to keep the individual prices.

  Determine how to track where items are located
  - what to do if item is split between multiple locations - use actual total at locations
  - what location is comprised of (building, room, storage unit, place in storage unit)
    -- room, storage unit, shelf, where on shelf (left, middle, front, back, right)
    -- building may be future
  
  Do we want to track expiration/best used by dates - maybe future
  
  Do we want to track special diet items - yes
  -- gluten-free, corn-free
  -- also allergy
