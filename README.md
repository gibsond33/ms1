Management System extraction of original code from hard copy listing and i
card decks with re-implementation using GnuCobol 3.1 trans-compiler.

The doc folder has what scraps we have been able to find. Skinny Bob remembers 
John having the majority of the documentation. Bob does not know where the 
material went when John left.

Decision made to comment the reconstructed code as much as possible to reduce
need to handle documentation in fair to poor condition.
